## Personal Reflections

This has been an exercise in confidence and in thinking like a programmer. Learning TDD, and more specifically, how to break down code granually so each intended functionality can be independently tested, has been helpful in reshaping my understanding of programming as a whole.

Having to write the project as a JavaScript class has also been a fruitful challenge, as it allowed me to more concretely grasp such an abstract notion. The writing process for this project has been a surprising delight.
